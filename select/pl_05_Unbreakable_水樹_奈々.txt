Some say That nothing's ever built to last
There's no way That you can ever stop the crash
But I say let the rain Let the rain
come down let it weaken the ground
Cause we will stand Forever
*
Unbreakable Unshakable
Built a house on a rock that will never fall
So... Unbreakable
Another broken heart From a world apart
Now we're stronger then ever that's what we are
So... Unbreakable
We fight Never easy keeping what we have
We cry But we always find a way to laugh
So I say hold me close
Don't let go don't you dare let go
And we'll stand
Forever
*Repeat
And I say yeah Nothing worth having is easy
I say yeah But as long as we're together we know
We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable
*Repeat
